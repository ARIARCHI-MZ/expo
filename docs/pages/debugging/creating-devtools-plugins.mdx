> **warning** Dev Tools plugins are compatible with SDK 50 and above. The process for creating a plugin is still in beta and may change in the future.

You create a dev tools plugin, whether that's for inspecting aspects of a common framework or library or something specific to your custom code.

A plugin consists of three key elements:
- an Expo app to display the dev tools web user interface
- an **expo-module.config.json** for Expo CLI recognition 
- calls to `expo/devtools` API for the app to communicate back and forth with the dev tool's web interface

Plugins can be included inside your app's monorepo or distributed separately on npm.

## Create a plugin

### Create an Expo app

The web interface of your dev tool will be an Expo app. Create a new blank Expo app:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app']} />

Then, add the packages required to build the app for the web and to use the dev tools API:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install react-native-web react-dom']} />

### Update package.json

Move any dependencies from `dependencies` to `devDependences` in **package.json**. These dependencies are needed for building the web version of the dev tools UI, and are part of your app's development. Having them in `devDependencies` ensures they are not included in your app.

```diff package.json
"dependencies": {
-  "expo": "~50.0.0",
-  "react": "18.2.0",
-  "react-dom": "18.2.0",
-  "react-native": "0.73.0",
-  "react-native-web": "~0.19.6"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@babel/core": "^7.20.0",
  "@expo/webpack-config": "^18.1.2",
+  "expo": "~50.0.0",
+  "react": "18.2.0",
+  "react-dom": "18.2.0",
+  "react-native": "0.73.0",
+  "react-native-web": "~0.19.6"
},
```

Add a `homepage` field to define the exported base URL for web in the format of `/_expo/plugins/{pluginName}`. For example:

```diff package.json
  "name": "expo-plugin-helloworld",
  "version": "1.0.0",
+  "homepage": "/_expo/plugins/expo-plugin-helloworld",
```

### Add message sending and receiving code to the plugin's web UI

`connectPluginFromDevToolsAsync` initiates a client that can send messages and listen for incoming messages. When sending messages, make sure to identify the plugin by name using the `from` parameter:

```js
  import { connectPluginFromDevToolsAsync } from 'expo/devtools';

  const client = await connectPluginFromDevToolsAsync();

  client.sendMessage('ping', { from: 'expo-plugin-helloworld' });
  client.addMessageListener('pong', (data) => {
    console.log('receiving pong', data);
  });
```

A `useDevToolsPluginClient` hook is also available to provide a client entirely within a React component.

Client apps using your plugin will also be able to communicate using `connectPluginFromDevToolsAsync` or `useDevToolsPluginClient`.

### Build the app for web

Create a **package.json** script that builds the web app and moves it to the **dist** directory. This will be served by the Expo CLI when invoking the plugin.

```diff package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "expo start",
  "android": "expo start --android",
  "ios": "expo start --ios",
  "web": "expo start --web",
+  "build": "rm -rf dist web-build && expo export:web && mv web-build dist"
},
```

Then run the build script to export the plugin web UI and move it to the proper folder:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm run build']} />

### Create expo-module.config.json

Create an **expo-module.config.json** file and the required information to it. This helps the Expo CLI detect the plugin and serve the correct files.

```json expo-module.config.json
{
  "name": "expo-plugin-helloworld",
  "platforms": ["devtools"],
  "devtools": {
    "webpageRoot": "dist"
  }
}
```

### Publish your plugin

You can add this plugin as a package in your monorepo to use it directly in your app, or publish it to NPM to share with others.
