> **Warning** TV development is available only in SDK 50 and later, and is still considered experimental. Not all Expo features and SDK modules are available on TV.

React Native is supported on Apple TV and Android TV through the [React Native TV repo](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos).  It is not just for TV â€” it is a full fork of the core repo, and supports both phone and TV targets, including Hermes and Fabric support

By taking an Expo project and using the React Native TV repo as the `react-native` dependency, the project can be made to target either phone (Android, iOS) or TV (Android TV, Apple TV) devices.

The changes needed to the native Android and iOS files are minimal, and are made with a config plugin:

- iOS:
  - The Podfile is modified to target tvOS instead of iOS
  - The Xcode project is modified to target tvOS instead of iOS
  - The splash screen (`SplashScreen.storyboard`) is modified to work on tvOS
- Android:
  - AndroidManifest.xml is modified
    - The default phone portrait orientation is removed
    - The required intent for TV apps is added

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- An Expo managed project created for SDK 49.
- Apple TV:
  - Xcode 14 or later
  - tvOS SDK 16 or later. (This is not installed automatically with Xcode. If you did not install it at the prompt when first opening Xcode, you can install later with `xcodebuild -downloadAllPlatforms`).
- Android TV:
  - In the Android Studio SDK manager, select the dropdown for the Android SDK you are using (API version 31 or later), and make sure an Android TV system image is selected for installation. (For M1 Macs, choose the ARM 64 image, otherwise, choose the Intel x86_64 image).
  - After installing the Android TV system image, create an Android TV emulator using that image (the process is the same as for creating an Android phone emulator).

## Limitations

Some Expo features are not supported:

- Dev client and dev launcher

<Step label="1">

## Modify dependencies for TV

In **package.json**, modify the `react-native` dependency to use the TV repo, and exclude this dependency from expo install changes.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
{
  /* @hide ... your existing package.json */ /* @end */
  "dependencies": {
    /* @hide ... your existing dependencies */ /* @end */
    "react-native": "npm:react-native-tvos",
    /* @hide ... your existing dependencies */ /* @end */
  },
  "expo": {
    "install": {
      "exclude": [
        "react-native"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Install SDK 50 dependencies

SDK 50 is not yet released, but alpha packages have been published to allow features to be tested and tried out in advance. TV support requires SDK 50 alpha.6 or newer.

The commands below will upgrade your expo dependency to SDK 50 alpha.6, and ensure that the other installed expo packages are also upgraded to compatible versions.

<Terminal cmd={['npx expo install expo@50.0.0-alpha.6', 'npx expo install --fix']} cmdCopy="npx expo install expo@50.0.0-alpha.6 && npx expo install --fix" />

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Add the TV config plugin

<Terminal cmd={['npx expo install @react-native-tvos/config-tv']} />

Installing the package adds the `@react-native-tvos/config-tv` plugin to your project's **app.json**.

When installed, the plugin will modify the project for TV when either

- The environment variable `EXPO_TV` is set to "1"
- The plugin parameter `isTV` is set to true

Optionally set `showVerboseWarnings` to true to see additional information during prebuild.

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@react-native-tvos/config-tv",
      {
        "showVerboseWarnings": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Run prebuild

Set the `EXPO_TV` environment variable, and run prebuild to make the TV modifications to the project.

<Terminal cmd={['export EXPO_TV=1', 'npx expo prebuild --clean']} />

> **Note**: The `--clean` argument is recommended, and is required if you have existing Android and iOS directories in the project.

</Step>

<Step label="5">

## Build for Apple TV

After running prebuild, run the following command to build and run the app on an Apple TV simulator:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    'npx expo run:ios'
  ]}
/>

</Step>

<Step label="6">

## Build for Android TV

After running prebuild, start an Android TV emulator, and then use the same command as you would to start the app on an Android phone emulator.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    'npx expo run:android'
  ]}
/>

</Step>

<Step label="7">

## Revert TV changes and build for phone

You can revert the changes for TV and go back to phone development by unsetting `EXPO_TV` and running prebuild again:

<Terminal cmd={['unset EXPO_TV', 'npx expo prebuild --clean']} />

</Step>

<Step label="8">

## Create EAS build profiles for both TV and phone

Since the TV build is driven by the value of an environment variable, it is easy to set up EAS build profiles that build from the same source but target TV instead of phone.

The following example **eas.json** shows how to extend existing profiles (`development` and `preview`) to create TV profiles (`development_tv` and `preview_tv`).

```json eas.json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.2.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "base": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      },
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk",
        "withoutCredentials": true
      },
      "channel": "base"
    },
    "development": {
      "extends": "base",
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleDebug"
      },
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Debug"
      },
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "development_tv": {
      "extends": "development",
      "env": {
        "EXPO_TV": "1"
      },
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "preview": {
      "extends": "base",
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "preview_tv": {
      "extends": "preview",
      "env": {
        "EXPO_TV": "1"
      },
      "channel": "preview"
    }
  },
  "submit": {}
}
```
