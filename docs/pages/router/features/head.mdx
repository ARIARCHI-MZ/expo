description: Learn how to use the Head component to manage the meta tags and other important elements of the page head in a universal Expo application.

> **warning** This guide requires `expo@49.0.0-alpha.3` or above Everything listed here is still experimental. You may need to use [Expo CLI on `main`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/%40expo/cli#contributing) to use these features.

> **warning** **Currently in beta.** The Head API may change in the future when we add universal support for React Server Components. We will also add support for native meta tags in the future to maximize discoverability and SEO across devices.

The Expo `Head` component provides a simple and flexible way to manage the meta tags and other important elements of the page head in a universal Expo application. It is designed to be used in both web and mobile applications built with Expo Router. By using this component, you can easily enhance the search engine optimization (SEO) of their applications.

> Native support can be found in the [handoff guide](/router/features/handoff).

## Usage

Make sure to use the `expo-router` config plugin if you're using iOS:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-router",
        {
          // Set this to the URL where your iOS universal links can be accessed.
          // For example, if you build an app "Bacon Blog" and host at `evanbacon.dev`
          // then `origin` should be `https://evanbacon.dev`.
          "origin": "<PRODUCTION_URL>"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The `Head` component can be imported in any route in the **app** directory by using `expo-router/head`:

```js app/index.js
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import Head from 'expo-router/head';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>My App</title>
        <meta name="description" content="My App description" />
      </Head>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </>
  );
}
```

This renders the following:

```html dist/index.html
<html>
  // highlight-next-line
  <head>
    // highlight-next-line
    <title>My App</title>
    // highlight-next-line
    <meta name="description" content="My App description" />
    // highlight-next-line
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <div>Hello World</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above example, the `title` and `meta` tags are used to set the page title and meta description. You can use other props to set another meta tag, link or script tag.

The `Head` component accepts any web meta tags as children. It automatically renders the meta tags in the `<head>` of the page. All nested `Head` components will be merged into a single `<head>` element.

## Rendering

> `EXPO_USE_STATIC` is [available on main](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/21572) and not currently published.

The `Head` component can be used for static rendering with `EXPO_USE_STATIC=1 yarn expo`. It can also be used to update during runtime or in single-page applications, this is useful for updating the page title and favicon to reflect dynamic interactions.
