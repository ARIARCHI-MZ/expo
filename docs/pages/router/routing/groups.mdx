description: Learn how to define shared routes or use arrays to use the same route multiple times with different layouts using Expo Router.

You can prevent a segment from showing in the URL by using the group syntax `()`.

- **app/root/home.js** which matches `/root/home`
- **app/(root)/home.js** which matches `/home`

This is useful for adding layouts without adding additional segments to the URL.

## Shared routes

To match the same URL with different layouts, use **groups** with overlapping child routes. This pattern is very common in native apps. For example, in the Twitter app, a profile can be viewed in every tab (such as home, search, and profile). However, there is only one URL that is required to access this route.

```bash File System
app/
  _layout.js # Tab bar
  (home)
    _layout.js # Header
    [user].js # Matches `/baconbrix`
  (search)
    _layout.js # Header with search bar
    [user].js # Also matches `/baconbrix`
  (profile)
    _layout.js # Folding profile header
    [user].js # Also matches `/baconbrix`
```

> When reloading the page, the first match (alphabetically) will be rendered.

Shared routes can be navigated directly by including the group name in the route. For example, `/(search)/baconbrix` navigates to `/baconbrix` in the "search" layout.

## Arrays

Instead of defining the same route multiple times with different layouts, use the array syntax `(,)` to duplicate the children of a group. For example, **app/(home,search)/[user].js** creates **app/(home)/[user].js** and **app/(search)/[user].js** in memory.

You can use the `segment` prop of a layout to distinguish between the two routes.

```js app/(home,search)/_layout.js
export default function DynamicLayout({ segment }) {
  if (segment === '(search)') {
    return <SearchStack />;
  }

  return <Stack />;
}
```
