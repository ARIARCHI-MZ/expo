Expo Router supports styling using React Native's `StyleSheet.create` method as well as inline styles.

## Limits of React Native styling

React Native's in-built `StyleSheet` API was designed as a low-level API and does not provide support for modern features that simplify building universal applications.

When targeting the web, we highly recommend using a different method of styling. Methods such as ([CSS](/router/styling/css_web/)) allow responsive styling while streaming and avoid flashes of unstyled content.
