Expo Styling is an innovative styling solution for universal applications that helps you easily styling components for Android, iOS and the Web.

## Design Goals and vision

`@expo/styling` is designed from the ground-up to be a universal design system. It provides you the building blocks to create your own complex styled components or add complex styles to 3rd party components.

Instead of trying to force either Native or Web styling, we are building a new API with new concepts that take the best concepts from both.

## Key features

- **Universal** Use the best style system for each platform
- **Fast rutime** Small runtime keep everything fast
- **Fits right in** Works with existing libraries
- **DevUX** Simply setup and editor intellisense support
- **Loads of features** dark mode / media queries / themes / container queries
- **Pseudo classes** hover / focus / active styles
