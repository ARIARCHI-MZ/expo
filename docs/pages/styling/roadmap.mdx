Expo Styling is an ambitious project that will be releasing in three stagings, with each stage being production ready.

<Step label="1">

### Create a flexible native runtime:

CSS powers the Web and is a powerful styling engine. We need to create our own styling engine for React Native. While React Native has inline styles, it is missing concepts such as

- Style variables
- Media Queries
- Container Queries
- Viewport units
- Style functions (min/max/clamp/calc/etc)
- Transitions
- Keyframe Animations

During this first stage we will leveraging Tailwind CSS as the public API. Tailwind CSS is often described as "improved inline styles" - and already supports all the concepts we wish to introduce to Native making it an ideal choice.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

### Create a new Style API

The new native runtime will provide new concepts, so we will need a new API for to use them. This stage will focus on creating a new public API showcases the power of the new runtime. We will also address some of the rougher edge of universal styling such as differing flexbox specifications and style specificity.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

### The multi-platform vision

React Native's multiple platform vision will require new styling concepts. During this stage we will explore adding new native styling patterns (e.g. layout transitions) and improving the developer experience.
